I am actively looking for a reputable company that shares similar values and principles with myself to apply my engineering skills and help make an impact. I am a highly passionate full-stack engineer who is driven by building technologies with a purpose. My favorite tools to use are React, Node, Javascript, Express and Mongo among many others. 



I finished my degree in 2017 in Computer Science. While attending college I was working as a Personal Trainer and continued to work in the field while also maintaining my freelancing business. Once the pandemic hit, I began to shift all of my attention on software engineering and am at a point in my career where I would really like to be brought onto a company to grow as an engineer.
